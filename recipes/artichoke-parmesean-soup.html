   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>This artichoke Parmesan soup, a tangy, comforting delight,
      is made with tender artichoke hearts and savory Parmesan
      cheese. It's perfect for a cozy night in or a quick,
      delicious meal.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 (14 ounce) cans quartered artichoke hearts,
         drained and roughly chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol type="1">
      <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large pot. Add
         onion and cook and stir until softened, about
         5 minutes. Add artichoke hearts, garlic, and thyme,
         and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in chicken
         broth and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about
         10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in Parmesan cheese and lemon juice. Using an
         immersion blender, carefully blend the soup until
         smooth. Alternatively, you can transfer the soup to
         a blender and blend in batches, then return it to the
         pot. Discard any fibrous artichoke pieces that remain
         stuck to the blades, or strain for a smoother soup.</li>
      <li>Stir in heavy cream; season with salt and pepper.
         Simmer, stirring occasionally, until soup is heated
         through and flavors have melded together, another 4 to
         5 minutes. Garnish with extra Parmesan cheese.</li>

   </ol>
