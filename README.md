# odin-recipes
This is an Odin project exercise that will be improved on in future iterations as it is revisited by the Odin project

This will start off mainly just with HTML, so it will not be very pretty as CSS will come at a later stage in this.

The task is to build a basic recipe website from the HTML knowledge aquired thus far in the Odin Project.  We'll see
how much I have obtained and am able to apply.
